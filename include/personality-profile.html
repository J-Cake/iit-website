        The profile overview of the personality type given, states that I enjoy being creative and am very
        present-oriented. While I do note these qualities to be true and often find value in them, it is also an
        indication that there are some potential areas of weakness relating to group-work. It mentions an incredible
        mechanical and tactile intuition, which previously has aided me with design and construction tasks. My interest
        for technical and challenging tasks is also described in depth, affirming my sought for mentally stimulating
        problems. I believe this gives me the potential to become a very valuable member of a team, as I would be able
        to direct and explain issues with high accuracy, as well as produce clearly defined solutions quickly. As such,
        my role in the team would be to work in the front-lines, advancing the project.

        I’m told over various sources that <i>Learning Styles</i> is more of a misnomer, as the most effective education
        is a
        combination of all styles, so I’m reluctant to allow myself to draw conclusions from these results, although
        they do seem coherent with my previous understanding of how I work best.
        Regardless, <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=64-51-67&name_key=f23eca0e08">my results for the
            learning styles test can be found here</a>.
        An understanding of how I perceive and understand issues will allow my peers and I to communicate more
        efficiently, to convey information with greater precision to prevent ambiguity and hence miscommunication.

        This test is designed to measure creative abilities, by measuring how various concepts are connected and
        recognised. This would aid my team in directing tasks, as an understanding of how I am able to conjure new ideas
        would give direction towards which types of problems I solve most efficiently.
        The given results don’t indicate much to me, as I don’t believe these qualities are tangible enough to measure.
        My thoughts are confirmed when redoing the test with wildly different results for answers that were only
        somewhat honest.
