                        I started primary school in Germany, where I completed my 3rd grade.
                        I completed primary and high school in Australia, where I studied maths, physics and Japanese.
                        I spent a lot of time programming however, and completed my HSC major project for Multimedia.

                        Having recently completed high school, I have enough time available to myself for some personal
                        projects,
                        which I spend studying and learning the workings and internals of the Linux kernel.
