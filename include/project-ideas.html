    <h1>Coding on Mobile</h1>

        Programming can be mentally exhausting. To make life easier and more productive, eliminating the various points
        of resistance within the working environment can be a huge step towards improving efficiency. Sometimes however,
        adjustments need to be made to source files or scripts without direct access to the code base, be it over a
        remote shell or through a managed repository and a handheld device is the closest thing to a workstation
        available – and it should support your needs as a programmer, however often does not.

    <p>
        The biggest bottlenecks with programming on handheld and mobile devices are their limited screen real-estate,
        and most notably, their spoken-language-oriented keyboard – fine for short text messages or quick Google
        searches, but far from ideal for programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hence, I’m proposing a suite of mobile software targeted towards improving the mobile programming experience by
        completely reinventing the way software is written. Programming on desktop and laptop devices is done through a
        keyboard, and combinations of keys can be used to control functions of the environment to boost productivity
        even more. The analogue of this on mobile devices is gestures. Using combinations of strokes and touches on a
        screen, various features of the software can be operated and controlled in a much more direct and immediate
        manner, allowing productivity to be boosted substantially.

        But the keyboard is still problematic. To address this, the developer operates on a board of semi-graphical
        elements, which can be connected and interacted with based on a language-specific set of rules, which can be
        installed and used in the form of plugins. The programmer operates the surface by dragging fitting blocks to
        their corresponding location.
    </p>
    <p>
        Upon saving the document, the defined structure is exported through a plugin-defined way into the target
        language, allowing programs created through it to integrate with any existing compiler and toolchain.
        Since the surface is contained within an IDE, automation and management utilities to aid developers further will
        be included.
    </p>
    <p>
        The most notable requirements for software like this is the need for a device capable of hosting a development
        environment. Since modern web browsers fulfil these requirements quite comfortably, even on mobile devices, we
        can call this criterion met. Next is a sufficiently advanced gesture recognition algorithm. Ideally, the
        algorithm is able to distinguish between similar gestures, while allowing enough flexibility for minor
        fluctuations in movements. Since algorithms do exist for exactly these requirements, the criterion is also met.
        Lastly, a device should have enough screen real-estate for comfortable code-overview, although this is more of a
        user-preference than system requirement.
