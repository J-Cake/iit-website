                        Like with any tech-enthusiastic 10 year old, I discovered Lego Technic and Mindstorms.
                        It was amazing, because you could program them to do clever things. They had sensors and
                        motors on them, and it was just the best thing ever. I was hooked.

                        My Computers teacher eventually introduced me to <a

                        a graphical code playground focused around learning to program, and it was targeted at a younger
                        audience.
                        I ended up spending a <i>majority</i> of my 5th grade playing around with it.

                        You may have guessed by now then, that I loved programming. <br />
                        Of course I was still tied to the primitive block-coding language
                        with a mouse and a website to do all the heavy lifting for me.
                        That's when I fell into the world of the browser.

                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">Daniel Shiffman</a> is a YouTube content creator
                        known for
                        his association with the <a href="https://p5js.org">p5js Creative Coding library</a>. I spent -
                        well, it's safe to say,
                        a lot of time - toying with sketches similar in nature to his. I'd say that's where my intuition
                        and
                        experience with programming
                        was really distilled to the point of being able to create something truly useful.

                        I'd gotten to a point, where my lack of skills was no longer holding me back.
                        I remember a conversation with my mother where I explained to her
                        that I was learning at an exponential rate.

                        As I was nearing the end of high school, it became time for me to select my HSC major project
                        for
                        Multimedia.
                        The project had a huge number of restrictions on it, but I eventually settled on a program which
                        would allow users
                        to play around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean Algebra</a>
                        as
                        it's used in electronic circuits like CPUs and GPUs directly in your browser.
                        I'd completed the project to an honestly impressive degree, and I'm proud of it to this day.
                        In fact, you can access one of the earlier versions of it under <a

    <h2>What actually are my interests?</h2>

    <p>
        I like to think about things - I enjoy puzzles and logic games.
        I'm also told that I have a knack for languages and grammar,
        which would explain why I enjoy playing with maths and logic.
        If I had to describe my passion for IT,
        I would say it revolves around navigating systems of rules which can produce interesting behaviours.
    </p>
    <p>
        A good example is of me one night scrolling through YouTube, a video about this thing called an esoteric language called BrainFuck appeared. 
        Entitled something like <i>Can you create a programming language with only 8 symbols? Yes you can!</i> I just had to watch it. 
        The video mentioned that BrainFuck is Turin Complete,  meaning any <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/P-versus-NP-problem">p-type mathematical problem</a> 
        (if you’re determined enough) can be solved with it. 
        This just blew my mind. With technically only 7 instructions, the language could do all of maths. 
        Because the 7th instruction was a branch-if-zero instruction, you can implement loops, as decrementing a counter until it reaches 0 allows 
        conditional behaviours based on the result of a comparison. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So in essence, computer science. Although BrainFuck didn’t inspire my passion, as such – I knew what I was interested in long before – it really allowed me to see clearly why. 
    </p>

    <h1>So why RMIT?</h1>
    <p>
        As I’ve mentioned, I’m from Germany. Specifically from a city called Tübingen. The city is actually built around a castle, 
        turned university and is an incredibly well-respected university all across the world. 
        My plan was to return there and step into a bachelor of Computer Science. 
        But since Covid-19 and the Ukraine war, that’s looking unlikely.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img class="float-left width-huge-1" src="https://www.rmit.edu.au/content/dam/rmit/rmit-images/staff-site/home-page/RMIT_POS3.png" alt="RMIT Logo"/>
        Come one day, thinking about the future, I decided to have a look at what compsci courses are available in Australia and landed on 
        Open Universities Australia. Their landing page featured a popup prompt for a 1-on-1 talk with advisory staff. With not much thought, 
        I put my phone number in, not expecting anything. I got a call 20 minutes later where I got the chance to discuss some of my personal 
        interests and ambitions. As the conversation turned onto what courses were available to me, it occurred to me that Eduardo (the operator) 
        had already begun the enrolment process on my behalf. He explained to me that RMIT has one of – if not the best computer science and IT programs around, 
        and I gave up on the <i>I didn’t ask for this</i> thought and went along with it. I was further motivated because <i>Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology</i> has a nice ring to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        So to be perfectly candid, RMIT was much less a conscious and calculated choice, as it was a string of fortunate events and so far, 
        I’m loving every minute of it. 
    </p>

    <h1>My ambitions for my studies</h1>
    <p>
        When working on personal projects and reaching a roadblock, one of two things can happen; either, I ditch the project or I spend so much time researching 
        I basically force an epiphany upon myself. That famous <i>Aha!</i> moment is euphoric to say the least. My takeaway from this is mostly how many opportunities there are
        to connect so many disconnected pieces of knowledge into a huge web. While I feel that I have a good general knowledge across many computing and programming concepts and subjects,
        I do know from experience that knowledge always has gaps in it, 
        which I hope to close as much as possible by studying IT and Computer Science.
    </p>
