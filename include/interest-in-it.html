                        Like with any tech-enthusiastic 10 year old, I discovered Lego Technic and Mindstorms.
                        It was amazing, because you could program them to do clever things. They had sensors and
                        motors on them, and it was just the best thing ever. I was hooked.

                        My Computers teacher eventually introduced me to <a
                            href="https://scratch.mit.edu.au">Scratch</a>,
                        a graphical code playground focused around learning to program, and it was targeted at a younger
                        audience.
                        I ended up spending a <i>majority</i> of my 5th grade playing around with it.

                        You may have guessed by now then, that I loved programming. <br />
                        Of course I was still tied to the primitive block-coding language
                        with a mouse and a website to do all the heavy lifting for me.
                        That's when I fell into the world of the browser.

                        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman">Daniel Shiffman</a> is a YouTube content creator
                        known for
                        his association with the <a href="https://p5js.org">p5js Creative Coding library</a>. I spent -
                        well, it's safe to say,
                        a lot of time - toying with sketches similar in nature to his. I'd say that's where my intuition
                        and
                        experience with programming
                        was really distilled to the point of being able to create something truly useful.

                        Like with anything, the more you do it, the better you get and I was no exception.
                        I'd gotten to a point, where my lack of skills was no longer holding me back.
                        I remember a conversation with my mother where I explained to her
                        that I was learning at an exponential rate.

                        As I was nearing the end of high school, it became time for me to select my HSC major project
                        for
                        Multimedia.
                        The project had a huge number of restrictions on it, but I eventually settled on a program which
                        would allow users
                        to play around with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra">Boolean Algebra</a>
                        as
                        it's used in electronic circuits like CPUs and GPUs directly in your browser.
                        I'd completed the project to an honestly impressive degree, and I'm proud of it to this day.
                        In fact, you can access one of the earlier versions of it under <a

    <h1>But why do I like it?</h1>

    <p>
        I like exploring. I don't like physical things. I like to think about things. Turns out I actually enjoy puzzles and logic games. 
        My mum also says I have a great passion for langauges, which explains why I enjoy playing with maths and logic. 
        Exploring to me is discovering rules defining functions in systems to create interesting behaviours. I find it captivating.
